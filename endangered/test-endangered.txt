Extra Tests for Endangered program

These tests are extra tests we can use to check 
that a student has fully implemented the program.

If they have hardcoded any tests these will prevent that.

Run with:
python -m doctest -v test-endangered.txt


    >>> from endangered import categorise
    >>> categorise(9)
    'Critically Endangered'
    >>> categorise(75)
    'Endangered'
